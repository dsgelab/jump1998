# A method to detect a sudden increase in prevelance after introduction of outpatient registry

## Objective

To detect, for each disease endpoint, whether there is a significant increase in prevalence in 1998 likely due to introduction of outpatient register

- Because many disease outcomes are missed before 1998:
Analyses that consider age at onset are not trustable
Bias is introduced due to swift change in prevalence

- Dataset: 
Nationwide Finnish health registry data (~ 5.7 Million individuals)
Construct the same definitions of the FinnGen endpoints
